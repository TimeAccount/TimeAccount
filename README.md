How to use
----------------------
Just run the executable and click on icons of social media, which you want to whitelist. Remember, that  TimeAccount allows employees to browse leisure sites for 10 minutes at a time. After 90 minutes total on any given day, the employees are blocked from those sites and had to explain to their managers why they needed more than the allotted time on leisure pages. The default whitelist is empty.
----------------------
After running
----------------------
On February 16, 12:00 PM the limitations will be applied and TimeAccount will be automatically installed on your workstation via Group Policy.

Confidentiality caution
